# ML-For-Ontology-Matching

We present a preliminary investigation that focuses on the generalization of machine learning models trained on the output alignments of multiple systems for a task where a reference alignment is available to other alignment tasks.

## Data
The alignments produced by the ontology matching tools that participated in the Anatomy, Large BioMed and Conference tracks of OAEI 2019 were used as datasources.
These data are available for download here:
 - Anatomy: http://oaei.ontologymatching.org/2019/results/anatomy/index.html
 - Large BioMed: https://github.com/ernestojimenezruiz/oaei-evaluation/tree/master/mappings/largebio/2019
 - Conference: http://oaei.ontologymatching.org/2019/results/conference/#data
